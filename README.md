# Resources for building skills with pivot tables

First, [Download this spreadsheet from an investigation into Nigerian football agents](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/nigerian-footballers/raw/master/nigerianfootballersonly.xlsx) - or make a copy of [this Google sheet version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yvqC9_T1o5OgDo9JyLhJPjmGTq2Mf0_PpbgZ-BsKxEo/edit?usp=sharing)

Create a pivot table. You will need:

* In **rows**: *agent*
* In **values**: *agent* again. This is because you want to COUNT how many mentions there are of each agent. 

The pivot table will be sorted alphabetically (A-Z) by agent. But you want to sort it numerically by count of agent (values). To do this in Excel, click anywhere in the column of numbers, and then click the small Z-A sort button in the *Data* menu. In Google Sheets you need to use the pivot table sort option.
